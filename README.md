# chat_app

A Flutter Chat application project that uses Firebase Auth, Storage and Database as well as Push Notifications.   This is for practicing how to use
Google Firebase and how it works.

## Getting Started

This project is an application allowing you to sign in or create an account, add an image for a user and use a chat flutter application using push notifications.   It uses Firebase.

This is part of the Flutter Complete course but since it was outdated - these files have been updated for using latest flutter version and packages.

This project uses Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage and Firebase Database as examples of how to use.
